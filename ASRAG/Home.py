This paper discusses the various stages by which data science is implemented and describes some interesting business case studies on how large organizations like Apple, Facebook, Google, Tesla, Virgin Hyperloop, Netflix, and many more have benefited from Data Science.

Methods: The following data visualization techniques, i.e., Bar graph, Box plot, Bubble chart, Choropleth map, Density plot, Heat map, Histogram, Line graph, Network analysis, Parallel coordinates, Pie chart, Scatter plot, Scatter plot matrices, Timeline chart, Time series plot, Tree map, Violin plot, Word cloud are used on various Covid-19 datasets taken from Kaggle. Findings: Analyzing vast volumes of data is a tedious task and practically impossible, and hence data visualization is needed to make those datasets meaningful.",

    "description": "The rise of large language models (LLMs) and instruction tuning has led to the current trend of instruction-tuned large language and vision models (LLVMs). This trend involves either meticulously curating numerous instruction tuning datasets tailored to specific objectives or enlarging LLVMs to manage vast amounts of vision language (VL) data. However, current LLVMs have disregarded the detailed and comprehensive real-world scene understanding available from specialized computer vision (CV) models in visual perception tasks such as segmentation, detection, scene graph generation (SGG), and optical character recognition (OCR). Instead, the existing LLVMs rely mainly on the large capacity and emergent capabilities of their LLM backbones.",

    "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have drawn a lot of attention due to their strong performance on a wide range of natural language tasks, since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. LLMs' ability of general-purpose language understanding and generation is acquired by training billions of model's parameters on massive amounts of text data, as predicted by scaling laws \cite{kaplan2020scaling,hoffmann2022training}. The research area of LLMs, while very recent, is evolving rapidly in many different ways.",
